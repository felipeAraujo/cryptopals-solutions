# cryptopals-solutions
This repository is designed to solve the cryptography problems of the site cryptopals.com .

The solutions will be made at python at first time, and will have the solutions tested with unity testing, the unity tests will be puted together with the code.

In the future, until I made them all (Or if I received pull requests), I could think in put more answers in another languages.

I suggest that you don't look the answers until you find them by yourself. I strongly reccomend that you use this only as a comparison between your answer and mine.

Pull requests to improve the solutions are always welcomed.
